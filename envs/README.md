Environments in this subdirectory will be picked up in the "envs" attribute
of `env-th`.

To add a new environment, create a directory matching the environment name
and main entry point to the environment in a "default.nix". Directories
containing multiple environment definitions can be created. Consult "./default.nix" for details.
